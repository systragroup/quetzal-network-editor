* **new line in params info**: can now parse \n as new line. 


### Bug Fixes
* **polling internet error**. Format AXIOS error when we lost connection for 'Network Error' 'Please check your internet connection.'
* **CRS verification**: was not perform on geojson serialization (was a regression). allow others inputs/outputs to have no crs or a bad crs.
* **edit dup trip_id**: if trying to change the trip_id to an existing one. do not let the user do it. but let them change it as the edit dialog will stay open with an error notification.
* **Load OD**: overwrite already loaded ODs. [#545](https://github.com/systragroup/quetzal-network-editor/issues/545)
* **Long scenario name**: text wrap now. so any length is readable. [#546](https://github.com/systragroup/quetzal-network-editor/issues/546)

* **refresh token** now valid 4 years (was 30 days). ID token is renew after 1 day (23h) in the middleware of S3 and Axios.
* **Road links and node** will now export with column ID. this is better than a deepClone (slow) when adding the ID field. it could be remove when we export.
* **refactor** SidePanels to script setup.


### Optimization
* **update Geojson Road**: using the new mapbox function to update single Geojson features. this improve performance a lot. no more rendered geojson layer.[#527](https://github.com/systragroup/quetzal-network-editor/issues/527)
* **rlinks group modification and deletion**. Do not refrsh everything, just the moidified ones.
* **SidePanels and map** rendering improved. And remove unnecessary Store mutation that was slowing down. v-if first time each sidepanel is loaded. v-show then.

* **Run logs**: can now display and download logs in the Run page. (quetzal main.py was updated to write log files into /logs/ on S3. need to redockerize a model for this new feature) [#299](https://github.com/systragroup/quetzal-network-editor/issues/299)
* **Fetch Running executionUID**: when run page is mounted or run button is press. check with quenedi-backend (fastAPI) if this tuple (model/scenario) is running (another user launch it). If So, start polling this executionUID and prevent stating and saving. [#309](https://github.com/systragroup/quetzal-network-editor/issues/309)

Can now reuse nodes on import. and reuse nodes when drawing a line of moving a node (sticky nodes)

### Features

* **Sticky nodes**: when magnet mode activated (next to anchor). moving and drawing nodes will reuse existing nodes. [#494](https://github.com/systragroup/quetzal-network-editor/issues/494)
* **Fix conflict on import (index)**: drop matching links and nodes. rename indexes for non matching (but same index). Drop matching trip_id. Drop duplicate nodeIndex if their distance is <10m  [#127](https://github.com/systragroup/quetzal-network-editor/issues/127)

## [5.1.3] (2024-02-23)

No changes. Test for the deploy github Action

## [5.1.2] (2024-02-21)

### Changes

* **Speed rounded to 6 decimals:** Importing a quenedi network changed time on some links some time because of the poor speed precision.

## [5.1.1] (2024-02-19)

### Bug fixes

* **new password:** was not possible to set as the button was always loading.

## [5.1.0] (2024-02-15)

PT Links speed, length and time are correlated.
Changing speed will change the time, while changing length or time will change the speed.
As usual. length is computed with the Linestring geometric length, so moving a node, adding an anchor
or drawing will change the length and time.`<br>`
Those are also computed on import when files are imported.`<br>`
length is geometry length and time computed with speed. if no speed, use 20kmh.

### Features

* **Computed Speed:** speed on each link. change speed on a group to change every Links time. [#466](https://github.com/systragroup/quetzal-network-editor/issues/466)
* **Map style selector** select a map style (sattelite and more). [#468](https://github.com/systragroup/quetzal-network-editor/issues/468)
* **duplicate without reverse trip** add a checkbox for reverse when clicking duplicate and reverse on a PT Trip.. [#472](https://github.com/systragroup/quetzal-network-editor/issues/472)
* **3D mode on all map**: right click to pan. not only with extrusion result maps.
* **Search bar for Trips**:added a seach bar for TripId. change behaviour when there is too much to filter. now the filter is applied and it display that there is nothing to display instead of not applying the filter and pushing a notif. This is simpler with the new search string. [#476](https://github.com/systragroup/quetzal-network-editor/issues/476)
* **Parallel step function**: handle in the front. It will be display as a single Step (ex: (2) step 1 | step 2) [#475](https://github.com/systragroup/quetzal-network-editor/issues/475)

### changes

* **Sorting v-select** most select field (ex: side panel filter choices) are now sorted.
* **OD name set to index** while create. name is populated with index. it is also now the default filter.
* **links time and length** are computed when imported. length is geometry length and time computed with speed. if no speed, use 20kmh.

### Bug fixes

* **Edit Link when road mode**: bug when a double click would start editing PT links while on road mode. It would be impossible to quit this edition mode as tabs are disabled .
* **cannot duplicate and revserse when editing**: The non edited version were clone. as it is not what we want, the button is simply disabled when we edit a line. (save then duplicate) [#469](https://github.com/systragroup/quetzal-network-editor/issues/469)
* **New (and copy) scenario user email** Changed MetaData of copied scenario on S3 for the userEmail (the one who click copy or new). [#449](https://github.com/systragroup/quetzal-network-editor/issues/449)
* **delete files on s3** when deleting a otherFiles (inputs/outputs) delete them on s3 when saved. [#473](https://github.com/systragroup/quetzal-network-editor/issues/473)
* **remove legend** when the range is NaN NaN (ex: using a attributes that is a color). [#477](https://github.com/systragroup/quetzal-network-editor/issues/477)
* **Static layer order** was not maintained when the map was changed or dark mode toggle. it is now fixed.
* **Fix traduction** in script setup components, gettext in script was not working.
* **OD creation** fix left click drag stopping the drawing process. fix a bug where the OD drawing was still active when changing mode (ex: going to road while a OD was beeing drawn.)
* **Copy project** : bug where we had random files on s3 (ex: ./styles.json). now. files starting with ./ are ignore in the copy. This is also fixed in the back. no more ./styles.json
* signin Dialog not shaking more than one time. add loading to button when waiting auth api response (aws-sdk).

## [5.0.0] (2024-01-15)

# What's Changed

This version is almost a complete rewrite as we upgraded to Vue3 and th composition api. [#193](https://github.com/systragroup/quetzal-network-editor/issues/193)`<br>`
The most notable library changes:

- Vue 2 -> Vue 3
- Vuex -> Pinia
- Vuetify 2 -> Vuetify 3
- aws-sdk 2 -> aws-sdk 3
- Webpack -> ViteJS
- Fontawesome 5 -> Fontawesome 6
- Mapbox-gl 2 -> Mapbox-gl 3
- Vue-mapbox -> Vue-mapbox3

### Features

* **Static Layer order:** Can now change the order of the visible layer by dragging. It is not the click order but the actual list order that defined the order on the map now.
* **Zoom on images:**  added a page scaling on the bottom right of the image page [#454](https://github.com/systragroup/quetzal-network-editor/issues/454)
* **Project list:**  cloud project selection is now on the Import page [#457](https://github.com/systragroup/quetzal-network-editor/issues/457)
* **Preset download :** Preset can now be downloaded in the side panel of the result page. (like links, rlinks and OD).   [#455](https://github.com/systragroup/quetzal-network-editor/issues/455)
* **Other files delete:** other files can now be deleted in the import page. [#455](https://github.com/systragroup/quetzal-network-editor/issues/455)
* **Erase All button:** Erase all button (import page) will erase all in a project without logging out of it. You can now deselect a loaded project by clicking on it. [#460](https://github.com/systragroup/quetzal-network-editor/issues/460)

### Optimization

note: the improvement on geojson layers (PT,road,result,static) drastically improve the memory consumption and fix most instance of crash with large project. `<br>`
For example, a large project with PT and road links visibles uses 400Mb instead of 2.8Gb.

* **Download Speed:** other files are only fetches when needed. This improve a project load time (from the cloud). This includes geojson layer, csv and png. This also optimize the ram used. [#410](https://github.com/systragroup/quetzal-network-editor/issues/410)
* **Upload speed:** MD5 hash faster to skip the updload of a unchanged file.
* **Scenario list:** List of scenarios fetch faster. The Emails adress was the bottleneck. They are added as they are fetch after the list. [#462](https://github.com/systragroup/quetzal-network-editor/issues/462)
* **Road Links:** Splitted into Static and Editable. There is no more watcher on both of them. The map is updated manually with each action (i.e. zoom, change visible, edit, draw, ect)
* **PT Links:** There is no more watcher on Static Links. The map is updated manually with each action (i.e. change visible)
* **Results Links:** There is no more watcher on it. The map is updated manually with each action (i.e. change visible, apply settings, etc.)
* **Static Links:** There is no more watcher on it. the layer is static and never change.
* **CSV page:** Only the visible value are rendered. New values are fetch (from ram) as we change page or change filter. There is also the used of a webWorker to parse the csv.
